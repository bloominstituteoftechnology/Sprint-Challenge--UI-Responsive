1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
The class furthest to the right has the most specificity weight, so it would be "box3".
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
Using the property 'display: block' makes the element stretch the entire width of the page. Using the property 'display: inline' makes the elements adjacent to one another as if they were on the same line.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
When using the property 'align-items: center' with flexbox, this will adjust elements on the cross axis.
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
A fixed layout has static properties that don't change relative to the display. An adaptive layout has static properties as well but also incorporates breakpoints to accommodate various screen sizes. A fluid layout is percentage based and adjusts itself relative to the screen size. A responsive layout uses percentages and breakpoints to be more flexible depending on the display.
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
This is so that we can use it as a base width to calculate percentages for the elements relative to that container.
