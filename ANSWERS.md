1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight? They are all equal.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`. Display block will break the line while inline will try to stay on the same line with its content.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
Cross-axis.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
Fixed has no breakpoints and isn't percentage based.
Adaptive has breakpoints but lacks percentages.
Fluid has all %based but no breakpoints.
Responsive is a mix of adaptive and fluid.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website? To avoid the content from stretching and I would assume to also give the media queries a reference point.
