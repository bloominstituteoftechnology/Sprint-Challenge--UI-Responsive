1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

    All of these classes have equal specificity weight to each other unless combined.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

    'display: block;' will display the element on a new line and take up the whole width, while 'display: inline;' will display the element on the same line and any height and width properties will have no effect.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

    cross axis.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

    A fixed layout does not adapt to the screen size of the user's device. An adaptive layout relies on predefined screen sizes to adapt itself to resolutions across devices. A fluid layout adjusts to the screen resolution of the user by applying percentage widths. A responsive layout provides precise viewing experiences, adapting to all screens across devices by applying media queries.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

    So that the content within the container does not bleed over the edge of the viewport.
