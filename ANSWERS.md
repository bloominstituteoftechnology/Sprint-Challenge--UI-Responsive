1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

box3 will have the most weight since it is occurs most recently.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

'display: block;' is associated with vertical alignment of items.  The item to which the style is applied will not have other items to the side (within the container).

'display: inline;' is associated with horizontal alignment.  The item to which this style is applied will not have items below (within the container)

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

'align-items: center;' aligns items centrally along the cross axis.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

A website with a fixed layout does not adjust when the browser window changes while a fluid layout does adjust in a continuous manner.  A website with an adaptive layout is built to change based on specified breakpoints.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

Without the max-width property, the webpage will stretch horizontally without limit when a user increases the width of the browser window.  This will negatively impact the design and consequently, the user experience.
