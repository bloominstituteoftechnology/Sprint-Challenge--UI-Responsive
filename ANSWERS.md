1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

They all carry an even weight.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

display block will take up all of the horizontal room regardless of its size.
display inline allows the items to dislay on the same line as something else.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

vertical axis

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

a fixed layout won't change when you adjust the view port. a fluid layout will shrink and grow with the view port based on width. adaptive and responsive layouts will shift completely based on a breaking point meant for different screen/device sizes. 

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

So that the width can continually change up until a certain point. If the width is just defined outright then things won't shift (I learned this the hard way today).
