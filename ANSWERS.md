1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
    The box classes are equivalent in specificity.
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
    'display: block;' means an element will take up the all the available width and start and end on a new line while 'display: inline' means an element will take the least amount of space it needs.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
    When using the property 'align-items: center', the axis being used is the cross-axis, assuming the flex-direction is row.
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
    Fixed layout means that a page has a fixed width at any screen resolution.
    Adaptive layout means that a page has different layouts based on the users screen resolution.
    Fluid Layout means that a page has percent-based width settings that will stay the same proportion at any screen resolution.
    Responsive layout means that a page has breakpoints where at different screen resolutions that page layout is different. Page text or images should expand or shrink depending on size.
