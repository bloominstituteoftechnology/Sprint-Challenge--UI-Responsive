1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
<box3> because it is the last class in the list.
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
Display block: are larger spaces, you are able to use height, width, padding(all directions), margin(all directions).

Display inline: are spaces that really only use margin (L or R) and padding (L or R). The only move horizontally. Mostly used in text.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
Cross axis
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
Fixed: Is not responsive, the page will not cater for smaller or larger screens. The page is at a fixed size and remains that way.
Adaptive: Is responsive, it has the ability to change its layout for the type of screen that it is being viewed on. The page changes the smaller or larger it gets.
Fluid:Is a responsive layout that changes the layout of the page using percentages for a smoother look in the changing process. Instead of the jumpy look of Adaptive, fluid eases into the new layout naturally.
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
Max-width is used to set the scale for the page, it is the max size of the page. It will never be bigger and also all of the content within the container must fit to the set max-width in order to work.
