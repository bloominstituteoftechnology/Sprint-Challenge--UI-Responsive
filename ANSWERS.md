1. anything with the !important tag holds the most weight, but !impotrant aside, 'box. box1. box2. box3' shold have the most weight.

2. display:block has a static arrangement where each object takes up the maximum space horizontally, display:inline I don't really know what it does.
We only really worked with diplay:inline-block, then display:flex, so if we went over what properties display:inline has, I forget them.

3. cross axis.

4. fixed layout will not adjust to screen size, adaptive has break points, fluid is percent based and shrinks/grows with your viewport,
and responsive combines adaptive and fluid properties.

So that no matter how large a screen is, the container cannot go beyond x width
as going beyond that might distort images, make paragraphs of text unreadable, etc etc.



1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
