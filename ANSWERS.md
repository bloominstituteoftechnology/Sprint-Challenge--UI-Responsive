1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
box3
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
A block display is when items can't be laid side by side, where the item's "box" stretches across the whole width. Some things that are defaulted as display: block are paragraphs, headers. Inline can be laid side by side, like pictures or navigation elements.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
The cross axis.
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
A fixed layout does not adjust to the user's screen, it stays the way it is. It has no breakpoints and no percentage based layouts. An adaptive layout has breakpoints but no percentage based layout. A fluid layout is all percentage based. Responsive is a mixture of breakpoints AND percentage based layouts.
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
Max-width tells the CSS what our maximum width of the screen will be. Without it, say we have a monitor with a wide screen, the items would just stretch obscenely.
