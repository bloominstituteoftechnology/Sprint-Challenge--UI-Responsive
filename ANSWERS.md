1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

Not sure. I'd say the last, but that only refers to what comes last in the css.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

Block won't have anything next to is, where as inline could have stuff next to it or inline with it.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

'Align-items' uses the Cross axis

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

Fixed - Does not move, will have navigation bars.
Adaptive - Adapts to different sizes of screens, but adapts to pre-determined screen sizes.
Fluid - Uses percentages in layout to adapt design to screensizes, but can make images very small.
Responsive - Adapts to all screens across varying devices.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

It improves userability on smaller windows and helps to make it responsive.
