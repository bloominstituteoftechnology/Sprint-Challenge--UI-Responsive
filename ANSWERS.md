4. Fixed (aka static) layout has a fixed width in pixels. The ‘container’ of the website is programmed to not move.
With fluid layout you specify sizes not in pixels, but in percentages. Meaning, if the screen size changes, the proportion of elements will stay the same.
Adaptive layout means that there are several versions of the layout which are displayed based on the screen size of the viewer. 
Responsive design takes the best of the two worlds of fluid and adaptive design. There are several so-called breakpoints, which divide all possible screen sizes in ranges.
