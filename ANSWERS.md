1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

Ans: box3 has the most specificity weight, because it is furthest to the right. 


2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

Ans: display: block means the element will take up the entire width of the page, while display: inline only takes up the width of the content. 

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

Ans: The axis used for this is the cross axis. 

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

Ans: Fixed layout lays out the content just as it appears in the index.html document. Adaptive layout makes use of breakpoints to change the display at different widths. Fluid layout uses percentages of the children being divided into the parent elements. Responsive layout uses a combination of adaptive and fluid. 

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

Ans: Because you want to have everything contained within the width of the viewport. If you do not set a max-width of the outer most container, it will try to take up the entire width.
