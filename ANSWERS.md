4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
Fixed layout is static and unchanging depending on screen size, adaptive allows for multiple versions of the layout, each displayed based on the screen size of the user, and fluid allows for percentage based sizing so as the screen size changes, the proportions stay the same. Finally responsive combines adaptive breakpoints and fluid sizing for a fully responsive screen based on the users viewport
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
if you don't set a max width in a responsive website you allow the screen to continue to stretch and resize even when it stops being valuable on the largest screen sizes
