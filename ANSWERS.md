1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
    - 'box' would initially carry the most weight unless one of the box# carried a !important override. 
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
    - block uses the full width size while inline just takes up as much as necessary.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
    - the y axis
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
    - fixed => a static page.
    - adaptive => adapts based on predefined pixle layouts.
    - fluid => scales % ratios
    - responsive => ratio based adapting layout
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
    - so it doesn't over scale and cut or clip the container.
