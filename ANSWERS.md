4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
A: Fixed layouts have fixed widths and don't adjust at all.  Adaptive layouts will have predefined layouts depending on the screen size.

Responsive layouts are a kind of hybrid of fluid and adaptive.
