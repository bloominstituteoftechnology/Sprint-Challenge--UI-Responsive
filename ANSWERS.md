1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
    Box 3, because it is the most last and most recent tag
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
    `display: block;` will take up the entire width of the page and will occupy that specific line on the page. 
    `display: inline;` only takes up as much space as needed to render the item.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
    `align-items: center` would be the center of the block based on the y axis
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
    A fixed layout is when the items on the webpage are static and are hard coded in place.
    A adaptive layout is when the items on the webpage change to fit the width of the viewer but only at certain sizes. 
    A fluid layout is written with percentages instead of the traditional pixels
    A responsive layout is when all of the items on the webpage will adapt perfectly no matter how a viewer changes. 
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
    So that the max-width is set and adheared to by all of the children elements and that they do not go beyond that point.
