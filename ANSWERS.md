    Fixed layout relies on a set width and the site won't respond to any resolution changes.

    Adaptive layout will change to specific breakpoint resolutions but will not respond to changes between those set resolutions.

    Fluid layout will respond to any viewpoint resolution but will not use resolution breakpoints and the same website will be used for any resolution.

    Responsive: A combination in adaptive and fluid layouts in order to achieve a
    seamless fluid experience between phone, tablet, and desktop viewports.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
