1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?  
-- .box3
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`. 
-- 'display: inline;' moves consecutive html items onto the same line, while 'display: block;' automatically bumps separate items to the next line down.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
-- cross-axis
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
-- Fixed: items are fixed on a page and do not adjust to changing viewport sizes, much like a scanned document file.
-- Adaptive: only uses fixed widths within the media queries
-- Fluid: items can stretch and shrink according to the viewport, but no fixed widths; do not maintain aspect ratio.
-- Responsive: items use a combination of fixed width and percentages within media queries to adapt to multiple viewports.
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
-- so the user can view the best representation of the page on any device or viewport size.
