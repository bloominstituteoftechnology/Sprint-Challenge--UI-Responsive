A1: box3 has the highest specificity weight.

A2: THe best way for me to do this is with an example- text displayed with block is put into a text box. The backgrounds and borders can be added as well as changing the size. Text, when inline, which is the defaut, won't wrap to specific dimensions.

A3: The cross-axis.

A4: FIXED: width is hardcoded in. It does not change, regardless of viewport or resolution.
 ADAPTIVE:This means that there are multiple versions of the layout. Screen size determines which sized layout is displayed. 
FlUID: sizes are determined by percentages, not pixels. Pages stay proportional.
RESPONSIVE: Using breakpoints, the laout changes according to screen size. Within that, it allows for the shrinking and growing of elements for the most tailored experience for the user, regardless of device. 

A5: Max width is used to prevent a horizontal scroll bar. Unlike setting `width`, `max-width` allows the laylout more flexibility because it can shrink with the viewport. 

1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
