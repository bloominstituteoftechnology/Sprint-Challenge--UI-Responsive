1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
box3
2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
In display block, elements try to take the whole width of a container. In inline, they will align with other elements as long as there is enough width.
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
cross
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
fixed is hard coded; not going to change. Adaptive responds to different screen widths. fluid is percent based.
responsive responds to media queries along with different element layouts.
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
So that extreme screen widths do not tamper with the design.
