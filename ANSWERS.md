1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?

Without seeing the CSS code there is no way to determine which one has
more specificity weight.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

Elements set to display: block take up the entire width of their container and don't allow other elements on the same line.
Elements set to display: inline don't take up the whole width of their container and allow more elements to be placed next to them.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?

The cross axis is being used

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

It allows for the proper use of flexbox to set widths with respect to the container. It keeps the page from looking bad when you zoom out.
