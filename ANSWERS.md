1. If you saw this HTML: `<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>` which class has the most specificity weight?
Box three has the most specificity as it's the last one.

2. Describe the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.
Display block creates a "block" area that includes the entire width, inline takes up just enough space for the element.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: `align-items: center`?
Align always refers to the cross axis.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
Fixed layouts have a set width and do not change with the size of the viewport changes.
Fluid websites use percentages for widths, this makes columns relative to each other and to the browser, so the website is scalable.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?
If max-width is used it is possible to set the margins to auto and then center elements within the container. This makes the website responsive in size to all device sizes.
