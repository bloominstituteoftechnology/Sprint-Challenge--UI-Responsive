1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?

    **box3**
    
2. Describe the difference between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

    **Display block will try to take up as much horizontal space as it can. Also, block elements will naturally stack up on stop of each other, vertical**
    
    **Display inline will only take up as much space as they need and will naturally be placed next to each other, horizontally**
    
3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

    **Cross axis**
    
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

    **Fixed: Is not responsive, has one look**
    **Adaptive: Has specific breakpoints to adapt to the different browser sizes, usually the width**
    **Fluid: Uses realtive units of measurements and will normally fill the entire width of the browser**
    **Responsive: Uses relative units and breakpoints, a combination of adaptive and fluid**
    
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?

    **This is a way to explicitly tell the CSS that an element should not go beyond a certain width no matter the width of the browser, but will typically be flexibile enough to handle smaller browser widths**
