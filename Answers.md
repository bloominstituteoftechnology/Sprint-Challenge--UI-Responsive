1) Class 3 has the most weight because it is farthest to the right.
2) Display block sits on a new line and takes up the whole line. Display inline puts the element as span level so it can sit with multiple elements.
3) align-items changes where the children of a flexbox sit on the cross-axis.
4) Fixed layouts are static pixel heights and widths. Adaptive layouts change the layout based on different media breakpoints. Fluid layouts use %-based heights and widths to adapt the sizing. Responsive layouts combine adaptive and fluid concepts.
5) The max-width setting keeps the content from getting stretched out excessively when viewed on a larger monitor.
