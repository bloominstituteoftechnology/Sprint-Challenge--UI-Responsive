1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?

      box3

2. Describe the difference between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

      Block elements take up the full width available to them, forcing anything next to them below.

      Inline elements will take up only as much width as is needed allowing other elements to appear next to them.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

      cross

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

      In a fixed layout element dimensions are fixed and they do not adjust as the screen size changes.

      A fluid layout is based solely on the viewport.

      An adaptive layout changes its layout at set breakpoints. The layout remains rigid if the screen size changes between the set breakpoints.

      A responsive layout adjusts to fit any screen size from mobile up to large desktop screens.
      
5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outer most container in a responsive website?

      Setting the max-width constrains the layout to a maximum size. Without it you would be moving more towards a fluid layout.
