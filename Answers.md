1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?

I would assume box3 would have the most specificity weight but Im a little unsure after all my reading on the web.

2. Describe the difference between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

"display: block" will start on a new line and take up the whole width. 
"display: inline" will just insert the element and display it like a span.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

I believe you are using the cross axies

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

Fixed Layout: Fixed layouts use static widths and heights on all elements and dont adaptive to changes in screen size.

Adaptive Layout:

Fluid Layout: Fluid layout use percentages instead of pixels, but other unit of measurement will work as well such as ems.

Responsive Layout: Responsive layouts are about using HTML and CSS to resize or move the content to make it look good on any size screen.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?

The reason that the max-width property is used on the outer most container is to effect all the elements that within that max-width.
