1. If you saw this HTML: <div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div> which class has the most specificity weight?

In theory, box3 is the most specific, but without seeing the whole file I can't be certain.  Box is likely the least specific, but since box3 is inheriting all of the previous box styling it will probably be the most specific.

2.  Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.

Block elements take up the entire width of their container.  A heading is a block element by default. Inline elements line up next to each other, side by side.  Imgs are inline elements by default.

While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?

What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
