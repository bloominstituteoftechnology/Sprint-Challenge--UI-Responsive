2. display: block; spans the width of its parent container
  display: inline; by default only spans the width of the content within it.

3. the flex box align-items: center property will aligning to the cross axis of the flex item.

  I. a fixed layout has pixel width's, paddings and margin's.
  
  II. an adaptive layout is just like a fixed width layout except it has media query's.
  
  III. a fluid layout uses percentage widths to adjust to the user viewport but can also have fixed elements within.
  
  IV. a responsive layout is made of both an adaptive layout and fluid techniques.

5. we need to use a max-width constraint on the outer most container so the page wont keep expanding on viewports wider than the webpage design.
