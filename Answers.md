Box3 has the most specificity due to it being in the farthest right position
Elements with display: block have a width and a height compared to display: inline.
Align-items: center uses the cross-axis!
Fixed layout has a fixed width in pixels. Fluid layout adjusts in percentages at breakpoint sizes. Adaptive layout can have several display layouts/breakpoints depending on the viewer screen size. Responsive layout combines both fluid and adaptive layouts by having breakpoints that provide ranges of screen sizes, which means the viewer has a flexible experience depending on his/her screen size.
Max-width makes sure that the container isn't wider than what is optimal for the viewers.
