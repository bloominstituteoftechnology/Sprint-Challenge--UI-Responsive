4. A fixed website layout will not adjust its content or display settings for browsers of different sizes. (Old School) A fluid website layout will adjust content size but not organization or display for browser size changes. An adaptive website is somewhat better in that it will display differently for different browser views, but it requires the creation of multiple layouts to function properly. A responsive web design gets around this by using media queries and cross-browser testing methods which achieve the same(sometimes better) effect of an adaptive layout without the need to produce multiple physical layouts.

5. We use max-width on the outermost container of a responsive website because otherwise our percentage values will cause our content/site to explode on larger resolution screens. It allows you to control the maximum dispaly of your content to make working down and creating mobile-friendly designs more manageable.
