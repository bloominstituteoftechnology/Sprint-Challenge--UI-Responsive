1. The class with the most specificity would be: .box .box1 .box2 .box3 {}

2. The display property has two values that determine if the child elements are aligned next to each other horizontally using inline or as a block with a height and width inside another element using block.

3. The align-items property uses the cross axis which is perpendicular to the main axis. The main axis can be either horizontally or vertically set using flex-direction.

4. A fixed layout is rigid and does not change depending on the viewport. A fluid layout allows the alteration of elements depending on the width of the viewport and can include fixed elements as well. An adaptive layout is a predetermined layout that adheres to a specific screen resolution matching the viewport. A responsive layout precisely adapts to any screen and is typically more symmetrical.

5. A responsive website depends on a responsive layout that uses the max-width property assigned to the whole html document. This allows all of the website's properties to use percentage values based on the limit set in the outter most container.
