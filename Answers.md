1. There is not enough information to answer this question. The order of
classes on a single HTML element does not determine specificity. Specificity
is determined in the CSS file.

2. A block takes up the whole width of it's placement and will block anything
in its path whereas inline will only take up as much space as it's content
thus being in line with it's neighbors.

3. Cross Axis

4. A fixed layout does not change in accordance with screen resolution thus
is not very user friendly. Adaptive on the other hand adapts to predetermined  
screen sizes that must be accounted for in the CSS. A fluid layout uses
percentage widths and thus will adapt to whatever size screen of the user,
though issues with pre-made designs ofter arise. Responsive is arguably
the best type of layout in this accounts for all users of all different shapes
and sizes, however, it is also the most time consuming type of design and
is not supported by all browsers.

5. We don't want our webpage to get all stretched and ridiculous if a users
has a particularly large screen.
