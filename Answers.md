The lower on the page and the furthest to the right has the most specificity weight, so going by that rule, box3 has the most specificity weight.
A display: block element starts a new line and goes to the left and right as far as it can. A display: inline element does not start a new line and only takes up necessary width. So, a <div> element is a block element, and a <span>, <a>, and <img> are inline.

A fixed layout doesn't move. The container has a fixed width of pixels. This layout causes a horizontal scroll bar along the bottom of the webpage if viewed on a smaller device. Adaptive layout means that the display adapts based on wht device it is being viewed on...so it's like several different sized fixed layouts. Fluid layout uses percentages rather than number of pixels so the display becomes longer and more narrow on smaller screens. The problem here is getting images to display properly. Responsive layout uses breakpoints to accomodate for every screen size. It's basically a combination of fluid and adaptive layouts.
Setting a max-width prevents the browser from adding a horizontal scrollbar on smaller screens, and makes sites more viewer and user friendly on smaller screens.
