
    1) If you saw this HTML: <div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div> which class has the most specificity weight?

    Box 3 has the most specificity because it is farthst to the right

    2) Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.

    "Display: block;"  tells an element to take up the entire width of the page or parent container, stopping other elements from being
    adjacent to them. "Display: inline;" tells an element to only take up as much space as it needs and can be adjacent to other elements.


    3) While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?

    The cross axis.

    4) What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

    Fixed Layout - Has hard set widths and won't change appearence when the browser is resized.

    Fluid Layout - Uses percentages for widths so that elements will scale based on the size of the viewport.

    Adaptive Layout - Introduces media queries to set up different layouts based on screen size so the site looks good whether
                      viewed on a desktop, laptop, tablet or phone.

     Responsive Layout - Combines the practices of Fluid and Adaptive layouts to give the user the best experience of the site regardless of
                        the device they choose to view the site on.

    5) Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?

    The max-width property is used in responsive websites to stop the site from stretching to great widths on a large desktop monitors, which
    would make the site look weird and stretched out.
