1. They are all equal. Whichever class is placed last will have the higher weight. If I say .box2{ background: black;} .box{ background: blue;} .box3{ background: red;} the background will be red. If I box3 at the first position and box at last, it will be box's color. 

2. If you want elements on the same line inside a block of html - use inline. If you do not want other html elements next to one-another inside an html block of code - use block.

3. cross-axis

4. A fixed layout does not modify/change content based on screen-size (or anything else for that matter). Adaptive layouts only focus on break points for content change and do not flex or shrink with small variations until a break point is hit. Fluid stretches and shrinks but the content stays relatively in the same format. Responsive is a mix of fluid and adaptive for an excellent experience on any device and for any user. 

5. So you have your working space and you know what your break points are and where your content needs to go.
