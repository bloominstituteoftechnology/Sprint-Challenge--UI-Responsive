1. "Box3" would have the most specificity weight since it is the element listed furthest to the left inside of the class. Specificity runs from least to most specific from the top of the page to the bottom first, and from right to left within single elements.

2. "Display: block" will force a break in the page between the element labeled as a block and the elements surrounding it. "Display: inline" will attempt to place the labeled element in the same line as its surrounding elements.

3. The "align-items: center" property works using the currently set cross-axis as a point of reference.

4. Fixed layouts refer to website designed with exact (usually pixel) values assigned to properties such as width, margins, font sizes, etc. This means that the design only appears as intended at the size and settings of the particular screen it was designed upon, and does not scale. Adaptive layouts use fixed width and other measurements set at various media queries to accomodate various screen sizes once the sizing falls within the set width values. Fluid (liquid) layouts use percentages of one set maximum width to ensure that elements in a design take up the same amount of space on different screen sizes. Responsive designs use media queries to redesign a layout to better accomadate different viewports and screensizes. 

5. "Max-width", when set in the outermost container, provides a global width constraint that elements of a webpage cannot push past, and provides an exact value from which all percentage measures are set throughout the page.

3. While using flexbox, the 'align-items: center' property would use the cross-axis for alignment.

5. Max-width set on the outer most container will determine how the percentages assigned to the 
   items will adjust when the screen is adjusted for different viewport sizes.
