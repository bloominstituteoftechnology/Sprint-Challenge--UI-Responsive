1. Class Box3 would have the most specificity weight.

2. Display: Block; will attempt to fill up as much vertical and horizontal spaceas possible based on the given width of the container, whereas, Display: inline-block will only take up as much horizontal space as needed by the content.

3. The cross axis of the flexbox is manipulated when using align-items: center;

4. A fixed layout will always render the same regardless of media, introducing a scroll bar when the viewport is smaller than the total width of the layout. Adaptive and responsive layouts introduce breakpoints that change the way the layout is rendered based on viewpoint size specific styling. Fluid layouts contain no breakpoints but are styled in a way in which the content renders the same regardless of the size of the viewport and does not introduce a scrollbar.

5. max-width is used in order to accomodate content that may exceed the width of the container when a window is resized without needing to introduce a horizontal scrollbar.
