1.	If you saw this HTML: <div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div> which class has the most specificity weight?
The class selector.box3 has the most specificity weight. 
2.	Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.
Display: block will cause the element to display on a new line and take up its full available width.  Display: inline will add elements to the same line, only taking up as much width as necessary. 
3.	While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center? 
With ‘align’ you are using the vertical axis, and so your items would be centered within a column or up-and-down orientation. 
4.	What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
A fixed layout has elements that are ‘fixed’ and not responsive to different device screen sizes, different resolution settings/zooming in etc. If the user does not have a compatible screen width, they have to use scroll bars to navigate left and right. An adaptive layout adapts to different device screen sizes using media queries. A fluid layout has converted elements components that make them responsive to the changing widths of the screen and resolution settings.  
5.	Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website? 
A max-width on the outermost container keeps the resolution and orientation of the elements intact on larger screens. A width at this level in general provides a baseline for compartmentalizing your adaptive and fluid elements.
