An Adaptive layout adapts to the users device because different layouts are created for different screen resolutions. A responsive layout has one master layout that adapts to all screens.
5. Having a max width to the outer most container adds a breakpoint at different widths so that the entire screen can behave differently when it views amongst different devices such as a phone or a laptop.
