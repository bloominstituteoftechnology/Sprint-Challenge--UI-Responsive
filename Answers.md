1. .box3 is the class with the most specificity.
2. With Display block, elements will stretch horizontally to take up as much space as possible. With display inline, elements will shrink to take up as little space as possible.
3. align-items works on the cross axis.
4. A fixed layout is fixed in the sense that it is not dependent on the viewport size. If the view port is too small, then scoll bars are introduced. An adaptive layout changes the page layout based on specific viewport(or device) sizes using media queries. A Fluid Layout uses percent based sizing to make the layout shrink or grow to fit the size of the viewport. A responsive layout combines fluid and adaptive layouts to create a layout that changes based on media query break points and grows or shrinks to fit the viewport size between those breakpoints.
5. In responsive layouts, max-width is used to preserve the disign of the layout on larger screens. It makes it so the size will not stretch infinitely, but will instead stop stretching at the max with of the website and let the browser fill in anything extra with white space. This makes a nicer looking site on viewports that are larger than the breakpoints.
