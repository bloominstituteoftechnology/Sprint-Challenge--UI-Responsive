1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?
-- box3 has the most specificity weight

2. Describe the difference between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
-- display: block, this starts a new line and fills the parent width and height.
-- display: inline, this displays element as inline and box size is equal to the size of the element.

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
-- not the main axis. perpendicular to the flex-direction axis.

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
-- fixed layout has hard coded width, height etc. adaptive layout has different layout for different screen sizes using media --queries. responsive web design works, no matter what screen size we have. it uses media queries as well as percentage based --layout.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
-- I think, we use max width because we need a base case on which we can develop upon!
