Sprint Challenge

1.  Box3 would have the highest specificity as it's last and doubley specific compared to Box.

2.  display:block takes its own space and doesn't wrap into text, display:inline just fits as close as it can.

3.  align-items effects the cross-axis which is opposite the primary one.

4.  Fixed Layout: Does not adjust with the viewport and remains one constant size.
    Adaptive Layout: Has breakpoints at which content looks good for different specific viewport sizes.
    Fluid Layout: Adjusts based on % at any breakpoint size.
    Responsive Layout: A combination of adaptive layout and fluid layout to achieve the best of both worlds.

5.  You use max-width so that on widescreen and ultrawide monitors elements aren't just continually stretched until
    they look terrible, You set a constant maximum size for the page with solid background around it.
