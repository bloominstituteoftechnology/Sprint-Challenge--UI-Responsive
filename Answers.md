1.	If you saw this HTML: <div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div> which class has the most specificity weight?
Box3
2.	Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.
The difference between block and inline is the ability to customize the width within the box model. Display: block element allows for the values to take up the full width of the page. The inline element allows for the information to be customizable all around, including width. This allows inline elements to flow as though reading on the average text editor. 
3.	While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?

Cross axis

4.	What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

Fixed layout remains the same as you zoom in due to fixed pixels. This static model, makes it so there will be a horizontal scroll page as the page will be distorted on other interfaces ie. Cellphones, tablets, and small to large laptops. 
Fluid layouts are those based upon the percentages using media tag. This allows for the page to use proportions to stay the “same” at different sizes.
Adaptive layout differs depending on the size of the screen, according to the code there will be a fixed range that displays the size based on the device. Can be described as a variety of fixed pages that go according to the size range established.
Responsive layout 
5.	Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?

In order for the container to properly adapt to media property allowing the page to respond to the changes in layout.
