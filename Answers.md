1. box3

2. display: block will fill up the entire width while display: inline will only fill up the element.

3. Y-axis, vertical axis.

4. Fixed layout is easiest to make but also will always be set a certain way and will not adapt to different screen sizes/resolutions.
A fluid layout will change with the screen size/resolution based on percentages but won't change the layout much. Mostly the width of the content will change.
An adaptive layout will adapt to a screen based on preselected sizes. It is more user-friendly but more difficult to deal with as you will need to set properties for each screen size.
A responsive layout is the most difficult to make but probably the most useful. It will respond and adapt to just about any screen size as long as it has been tested on beforehand.

5. So that things inside the container don't appear outside of it(?)
