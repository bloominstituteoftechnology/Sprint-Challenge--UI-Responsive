1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?
A - Box3 but when we have talked about specificity its dealt mainly with CSS not the classes inserted into an element. So Im not confident about this answer


2. Describe the difference between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
A - Display block means that the element has limits to its height and width. these limits are set natrually based on the content inside and does not like elements next to it.
Display Inline means that if possible based on width the elements will be displyed on the same line. 

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
A - Vertical axis

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
A - Fixed layout means you have one setup for your website and it has a fixed width and height
    Adaptive layout means it has some predetermined widths its looking for and it loads different content for different layouts
    Fluid Layout- uses relative units like percentages to define how elements on a page change with width and size of screen
    Responsive layout is like Adaptive layout in that the screen will change based on what size screen is given but a responsive page does not change the content that is delivered like removing and element or image. it just moves them around or makes them smaller.

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
 A -    We need the Max width property to give us a structrue to work with because we can't account for the largets screen but we can account for where we would like to start our screen design.
