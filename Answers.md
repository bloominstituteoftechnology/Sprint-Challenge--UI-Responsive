Question 2: Display: block means that everything in the element is displayed in a natural form. I.E Heder on top paragraph of information on bottom. Display: inline meaans that everything in the element is in a direct line and on the same line.
Question 3: 
Fixed layout: A fixed layout is a layout that uses fixed sets of width and fonts and does not adjust based off of windowsize or viewport. 
Adaptive layout: compared to fixed layout this layout is a bit more user friendly and changes the layout based on the device you're on
Fluid layout: A fluid layout is more percent based and can once again change depending on the window size and viewport but it makes sure Items on the page take up the same size on all different sizes.
Responsive layout: This layout is also percent based but can change the layout or look of the page no matter what screen size or viewport size. 
Question 5: The reason why we use max-width on the main container is because it will over-ride any width commandss to not go outside of the container and it also helps
when setting breakpoints for your responsive design.
