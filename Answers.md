1. If you saw this HTML: ```<div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div>``` which class has the most specificity weight?

Ans. CSS reads codes from right to left. So Box3 has the most weightage. 

2. Describe the difference between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

Ans. display: block; takes the whole row as real estate for the class. However display: inline; only takes the area thats directly taken by the text or img in the class. 

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?

Ans. Cross Axis. 
4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?

Ans. Fixed layout has hardcoded widths. adaptive layouts has breakpoints, responsive layout is fully responsive with percentage based widths, margins and rem fonts. 

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?

So that the max width for the website doesn't go beyond a certain size, since different monitors have different resolutions.
