1. If you saw this HTML: <div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div> which class has the most specificity weight?
    The class that has the most specificity weight is box 3. To determine an element's specificity weight, we can assign values to them. For example: #id's = 100; .class = 10; html elements = 1. Based on the values, box 3 has the most weight.       

2. Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.
    The display: block takes up the whole space and across all the way to the end of its container. On the other hand,  display: inline does not start on a new line and will take the least amount of space. To illustrate, a paragraph or p element is block while span is inline.    

3. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
    We are using here the vertical axis. 

4. What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
    Fixed layout does not adjust to the resolution or viewport of the device. The fluid layout adapts the website's width  to the device a person is using. An adaptive layout also adapts to the device but the changes are not too apparent. Finally, the responsive layout fully responds to the device with precise changes according to each device's viewport.         

5. Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
    The max-width needs to be set on the outermost container so all the elements will reflect the styling rules set at that max-width/breakout point.
