#Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;
    display: block means the element is displayed as a block with white space above and below the content
    display: inline means the element is displayed inline, inside the current block. Has the smallest width.

#While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
    You are using the Y- axis when you use align-items:center. All align-items are moved along the y axis.

#What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
    Fixed layout: Is a static site that is not responsive. It has a fixed width of pixels. The horizantal bar at the bottom shows when the screen is minimized. (Most fixed websites are 960px wide)

    Adaptive: Adaptive means there are several versions of the layout, mobile size set to a certain amount of pixels, tablet size set to a certain amount of pixels, and desktop size set to a certain size of pixels.

    Fluid layout: Fluid layout you specify sizes in percentages not pixels. 'Proportion ratio' of elements stay the same. 

    Responsive: Is the best of both worlds. It is both adaptive and fluid. It is sized in percentages not pixels and it has several versions to fit into mobile, tablet, or desktop versions.

#Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
    So that you can specify you only want these properties below the specified width pixels
