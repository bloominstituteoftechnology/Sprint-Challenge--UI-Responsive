1. box3
2. display:block will take the target element and create a block around with which you
can resize with a width and height. say for example you have text that you create a block for, it will create a block around that text. inline will let you target the element without haivng to correctly size a block to do things to it. if you have text in a sentence you can change certain things about it like color/font/size.
3. x axis.
4. 
fixed layouts will look EXACTLY the same on all devices, and will not scale. you will end up with horizontal scrollbars with this type of design. it is static.

adaptive layouts will actively change the design (100% depends on the size of the viewer) of the website for the most optimal experience 

fluid layouts will scale elements down because you are using percentages and not pixels

responsive designs combine adaptive and fluid by scaling the website between tolerances. once you reach a certain point (say the point between desktop and tablet) the website will switch to the optimised layout for a tablet, while still actively scaling it to fit the most screen it can.

5. because then the entire webpage will takeup the entire screen, which would look horrible (text streched comepletely along the width of the screen making it a huge pain to read)
