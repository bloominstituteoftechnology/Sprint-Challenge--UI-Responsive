1. box3 has the most specificity weight.
2. display:block dictates that the HTML element should sit on a line by itself unless overridden (e.g. with a float).  display:inline allows multiple items to sit on the same line.
3. align-items goes on the cross axis.
4. Fixed layout has fixed width in pixels and the layout does not change regardless of the screen size.  Adaptive layout provides several different layout designs based on the size of the screen.  Fluid layout specifies sizes in percentages rather than pixels.  And responsive design is a combination of adaptive and fluid layouts - sizes adjust by percentage, and layouts change based on different screen sizes.
5. max-width is needed on the outermost container to keep the page from expanding infinitely wide.  So for very large screen resolutions, for example, there is still an upper bound for the largest layout.
