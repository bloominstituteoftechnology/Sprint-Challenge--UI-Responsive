If you saw this HTML: <div class="box box1 box2 box3"></div> which class has the most specificity weight?
  box3 has the most specificity weight because it is last in the chain
  
Describe the difference between display: block; and display: inline;.
  display: block; takes up as much space on the main axis as it can, while display: inline; tries to take up as little space as possible.

While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: align-items: center?
  align is always on the cross-axis, so align-items: center centers the items on the cross-axis;

What is the difference between fixed layout, adaptive layout, fluid layout, and responsive layout?
  Fixed Layout does not change no matter the size of the viewport. Adaptive Layout only changes at specific breakpoints. Fluid Layout only   changes width based off the size of the screen. Responsive Layout changes width at all screen sizes, and changes layout at breakpoints     to accomodate all screen sizes.

Why do we need to use the CSS property max-width on the outter most container in a responsive website?
  We want to set a max-width on the outtermost container so that elements don't spread too far apart on large screens and make our website   look unproffessional.
