1: .box .box3 has the most specificity weight in the order.

2: display: block occurs as a block of paragraphs or headers. There are whitespaces below and above it and takes up as much width as possible.
Display: inline is displayed inline the blocks and only takes up as much space as it needs.

3: align-items: center are centered on cross-axis.

4: Fixed layout means that it is made for one outlet and is fixed for that position so when someone tries to open the page in another
outlet, it does not change to that layout. Adaptive layout is like several fixed layouts, there are several versions of the layout 
made for each outlet. Fluid layout means that as the screen changes, so does the proportion of the elements stay the same and changes 
to go with the change. Responsive design layout is the best layout and has many breakpoints, which divides all the possible screen sizes
in ranges. It is a mixture of fluid and adaptive layouts.

5: Max-width is used to put a constraint on the width. It tells it to go no farther than the max of that width.
