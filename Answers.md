    ~fixed layout = fixed width, will have white space for larger screens & horizontal scroll bars for smaller screens
 
    ~adaptive layout = adaptive breakpoints e.g. 768px, 400px; therefore developer have to create different layouts for different screen sizes
 
    ~fluid layout = white space is optimized for different screen resolutions & content will be resized by % based on user screen size
